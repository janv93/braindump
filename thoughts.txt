the observations are apparent to the observer but they may not be obvious to the reader. the observations are of such nature that they should not be understood intellectually but through meditation/direct observation. they serve as potential confirmations of the reader's observations.

concentration is the result of solving problems and being able to focus more energy on fewer problems, a virtuous circle, peaking in happiness when maxed

vice versa, loss of concentration, the increase of problems is a vicious circle once a threshold of virtuous to vicious circle is reached, peaking in panic when maxed

happiness is proportional to the ability to predict the next moment, up to a certain cap

after the cap, happiness transitions first to a flow state (psychic ability, iddhi), and then to transcendence, eventually the complete fading of patterns where death is transcended

iddhis are either 1. the capability of being in control of the entire environment or 2. the illusion to be in control or 3. both/neither as in the perfect adaptation of identified pattern to environment

vicious circle has eventual tendency to be perceived as curse and it may 1. be a curse or 2. be mere lack of concentration
