the observations are apparent to the observer but they may not be obvious to the reader. the observations are of such nature that they should not be understood intellectually but through meditation/direct observation since it's the faster way, meaning intellectual is possible but often leaves up too much room for interpretation. the observations serve as potential confirmations of the reader's observations

concentration is the result of solving problems and being able to focus more energy on fewer problems, a virtuous circle, peaking in happiness when maxed

vice versa, loss of concentration, the increase of problems is a vicious circle once a threshold of virtuous to vicious circle is reached, peaking in panic when maxed

happiness is proportional to the ability to predict the next moment, up to a certain cap

after the cap, happiness transitions first to a flow state (psychic ability, iddhi), and then to transcendence, eventually the complete fading of patterns where death is transcended

iddhis are either 1. the capability of being in control of the entire environment or 2. the illusion to be in control or 3. both/neither as in the perfect adaptation of identified pattern to environment

vicious circle has eventual tendency to be perceived as curse and it may 1. be a curse or 2. be mere lack of concentration

virtuous circle has similar tendency to be perceived as blessing

fasting leads to (temporary?) increase of concentration, similarly too much food leads to confusion

intentions inherently lead to confusion but suppression of intentions/actions also leads to confusion

intentions are driven either by craving or fear but suppressing the craving equally leads to confusion

while awake, absence of intention is proportional to intensity of observation

vice versa, observing leads to decrease of intentions

confusion as universal marker of wrong decisions

-

personality as interplay of experience (truthful, natural, can't get rid off) and role (untruthful, artificial, replaceable)

ease of life being correlated with increase in roleplaying patterns, hardship correlated with experiential patterns

roleplaying focused on short term solutions (getting a job, date) / getting others to do things for oneself

experience naturally creating focus on long term solutions (dealing with sorrow, lack of understanding) / independence from others
